# Predict Taxi Trip Duration - Data Science Project

## Introduction

This project aims to predict the duration of taxi trips in New York City using machine learning models. The dataset used for analysis is the NYC Taxi Trip dataset, which contains information about taxi trips in the city, including pickup time, coordinates, number of passengers, and other variables. By analyzing this dataset, we can gain valuable insights into taxi transportation dynamics and build a predictive model for trip duration.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this analysis is to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts the total ride duration for taxi trips in NYC. The model's predictions can be used to assist taxi service providers in resource management, enhancing customer satisfaction, and optimizing operational efficiency.

## Implementation

The project implementation involves the following steps:

### Step 1: Import Libraries

Import the required libraries, including Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Geopy, and other necessary dependencies.

### Step 2: Read and Explore Data

Read the 'train.csv' dataset and set the 'id' column as the index. Print the first 20 rows of the dataset to get an initial overview of the data.

### Step 3: Data Cleaning and Exploration

Perform data cleaning by removing outliers from the 'trip_duration' column. Explore the data using descriptive statistics and data visualization to gain insights into the dataset's distribution and patterns.

### Step 4: Data Preprocessing

Preprocess the data by converting date and time columns into datetime format. Filter the data based on latitude and longitude coordinates to include only relevant NYC locations.

### Step 5: Data Visualization

Visualize the data using various plots and charts to understand relationships between variables, patterns in trip durations, and demand patterns on different days and hours.

### Step 6: Feature Engineering

Create additional features like 'day_of_week,' 'pickup_hour,' and 'haversine_distance' to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.

### Step 7: Data Encoding

Convert categorical variables into numerical format using one-hot encoding.

### Step 8: Data Splitting and Model Training

Split the data into training and testing sets. Train the predictive models using RandomForestRegressor, AdaBoostRegressor, and XGBoost regression models.

### Step 9: Model Evaluation

Evaluate the model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess how well the models predict trip durations.

## Conclusion

The project provides valuable insights into taxi trip durations in NYC and builds predictive models to forecast trip durations accurately. The results can be utilized by taxi service providers to optimize their operations, allocate resources efficiently, and enhance customer satisfaction.
